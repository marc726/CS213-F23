Java interfaces allow for the abstraction of method signatures without implementation. This problem set will challenge your understanding of interfaces and their applications in Java.

### **Basic Implementation:**

Given the following code snippet, identify if it will compile successfully:

```Java
public interface Animal {
    void speak();
}

public class Dog implements Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Woof!");
    }
}
```

##### Solution: 
Yes, it will compile successfully.  
**Explanation:** The class `Dog` properly implements the `speak` method defined in the `Animal` interface.


### **Multiple Interfaces:**

Will the code below compile? If not, what's the issue?

```Java
public interface Swimmer {
    void swim();
}

public interface Runner {
    void run();
}

public class Athlete implements Swimmer, Runner {
    public void swim() {
        System.out.println("Swimming fast!");
    }

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Running fast!");
    }
}
```

##### Solution: 
Yes, it will compile.  
**Explanation:** The class `Athlete` implements both the `swim` method from the `Swimmer` interface and the `run` method from the `Runner` interface.


### **Overlapping Methods:**

Analyze the code snippet below. Will it compile?

```Java
public interface Mammal {
    void display();
}

public interface Bird {
    void display();
}

public class Bat implements Mammal, Bird {
    public void display() {
        System.out.println("I am a bat!");
    }
}
```
##### Solution: 
Yes, it will compile.  
**Explanation:** Even though both the `Mammal` and `Bird` interfaces have a `display` method, there's no ambiguity in the `Bat` class since it provides a single implementation for the method.



### **Abstract Class and Interface:**

Consider the following code. Identify any compilation errors, if present:

```Java
public abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void move();
}

public interface Flyable {
    void fly();
}

public class Airplane extends Vehicle implements Flyable {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Moving forward!");
    }

    public void fly() {
        System.out.println("Flying in the sky!");
    }
}
```

##### Solution: 
Yes, it will compile successfully.  
**Explanation:** The class `Airplane` provides concrete implementations for the abstract `move` method of the `Vehicle` class and the `fly` method of the `Flyable` interface.



### **Interface Default Methods:**

Examine the following code. Will it compile successfully? If not, correct the issues:

```Java
public interface Painter {
    default void paint() {
        System.out.println("Painting in default color.");
    }
}

public class Artist implements Painter {
    public void paint() {
        System.out.println("Painting in blue.");
    }
}
```
##### Solution: 
Yes, it will compile.  
**Explanation:** The class `Artist` provides its own implementation of the `paint` method, overriding the default implementation provided in the `Painter` interface.
